The first things you should be paying attention is the "Title" and "Keywords".
If after reading the title, the article was to our liking then we enter "Abstract".
(Abstract gives us a preview of the whole paper)
Then after that we read the "Conclution".
(Seems a bit odd but then we know what to expect of the paper)
Then we scan the "Results and Disscution" to know whats going on.
Then we read the last paragraph or last sentence of the "Introduction".
Then read the whole introduction.
(The most important sentence of introduction is the last one!)
Now that we have a far view of the paper is time for reading results and disscution sections one by one.
(We now know the things they were talking about is what)
Then we enter the "Methods" section which we will know HOW they did all the things they were talking about.
